### Hi there 👋

🌲 I'm a graduate student at Northeastern University, majoring in Computer and Software Engineering. Currently, I'm working as a **software engineer intern** at **[1Thing.Org](https://www.1thing.org/)** Sunnyvale, CA, a non-profit anti-Asian-hate organization. And I'm also going to have a **Full-time Software Dev Engineer internship** in Fall at **[Amazon.Inc](https://www.aboutamazon.com/)** Seattle, WA. 

🥳 I'm **actively searching for a full-time Software Development Engineer opportunity in 2024**. It's my dream to work in the tech industry and make a difference through my work. I've gained a lot of skills and experience throughout my academic and professional journey. I am proficient in several languages and frameworks including JavaScript, Java, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS, Node.js, React, Angular, SQL, Express, Bootstrap, Shell Scripting, Terraform and have experience with database like MongoDB, MySQL, SQL Server, MS SQL. I am also familiar with tools and technologies such as Git, Figma, IntelliJ, VS Code, Jenkins, Postman, Splunk, SONAR, Fortify, Docker, CA Agile Central Rally, Linear, PowerShell, and have experience working in AWS. I've launched multiple full-stack projects successfully, including a [mini search engine](https://github.com/Hao6666666/mini_msearch), a community shopping website [Lite-eBay](https://github.com/Hao6666666/Lite_eBay) also a smartphone based food ordering application using React Native - [GoEats](https://github.com/Hao6666666/GoEats).

🐟 Besides, I've also gained great experience in backend infrastructure and cloud computing. One of my most valuable experiences was working as a software engineer intern at Mitsubishi Electric. I developed and realized an internal product order system interface based on TypeScript and React. This experience made me even more curious about everything and equipped me with a strong logic and reasoning ability to break down problems and solve them one by one.

💪 I'm a good team member who takes responsibility for the team leader. I have a great sense of cooperation, and I always help my teammates whenever they face any difficulties. I believe in the power of teamwork and enjoy working with others to achieve a common goal. I'm confident that my skills, experience, and passion will make me a valuable addition to any team.
